# G-Theme for Matomo

![dashboard](/screenshots/dashboard.jpg)

A custom design of the Matomo dashboard and login pages. Using the Google Theme as a base to simplify the design and make it feel less cluttered. The theme and colour are based on my own website.

This theme is built on the Google Theme by ronan-hello and uses [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons in places.
